## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

### 1. Encapsulation
- **Definition**: Encapsulation bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, typically a class. It hides internal details and exposes only the necessary functionalities.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Public Interface vs. Internal Implementation**: Separates what is accessible from what is hidden, allowing for modifications without impacting external code.
  - **Data Protection**: Protects an object’s internal state by restricting access to its attributes, thus enforcing data integrity.
- **When to Use**:
  - To control access to an object's internal state, ensuring that it can only be modified through defined methods (getters/setters).
  - To maintain a clear API for users while shielding the underlying complexities of the system.

### 2. Abstraction
- **Definition**: Abstraction simplifies complex systems by highlighting only the relevant details while hiding the unnecessary ones, allowing users to interact with the system at a higher level.
- **Key Points**:
  - **User-Friendly Interfaces**: Provides a simplified view of an object’s functionalities (e.g., using a remote control).
  - **Loose Coupling**: Changes in the internal implementation do not affect users, allowing for flexibility and scalability.
- **When to Use**:
  - When designing interfaces or classes where users need to understand the overall functionality without delving into the details.
  - To create frameworks that abstract complex functionalities while providing essential methods.

### 3. Inheritance
- **Definition**: Inheritance is a mechanism where new classes (derived or child classes) are created from existing classes (base or parent classes), promoting code reuse through an "is-a" relationship.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Code Reusability**: Derived classes inherit attributes and behaviors from base classes, reducing redundancy.
  - **Propagated Changes**: Changes made to a base class can affect all derived classes, necessitating careful design.
- **When to Use**:
  - When there is a clear hierarchical relationship (e.g., Dog is a Mammal).
  - To leverage existing functionality while adding new features in derived classes.

### 4. Polymorphism
- **Definition**: Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon, enabling flexibility and extensibility through a common interface.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Dynamic Method Resolution**: The method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the object's type.
  - **Code Extension**: New classes can be introduced without altering existing code, adhering to the open/closed principle.
- **When to Use**:
  - To define interfaces or abstract classes that different implementations can fulfill.
  - When there are multiple classes that can be treated as instances of a common superclass.

### 5. Coupling
- **Definition**: Coupling refers to the degree of interdependence between software modules. Low coupling is desirable, as it enhances system flexibility and maintainability.
- **Key Points**:
  - **High Coupling**: Makes systems fragile, complicating changes and leading to potential errors.
  - **Low Coupling**: Facilitates easier modifications and promotes a more robust system architecture.
- **When to Use**:
  - Aim for low coupling by designing classes to depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
  - Utilize dependency injection to manage dependencies effectively.

### 6. Composition
- **Definition**: Composition involves creating complex types by combining simpler objects, emphasizing a "has-a" relationship, as opposed to inheritance’s "is-a" relationship.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Reusable Components**: Promotes code reuse by allowing objects to be constructed from smaller, reusable components.
  - **Loose Coupling**: Reduces tight coupling associated with inheritance, enhancing flexibility.
- **When to Use**:
  - When object behavior can be composed from various components without a clear inheritance hierarchy.
  - To avoid the fragile base class problem and increase system resilience to changes.

## SOLID Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Definition**: Each class should have only one reason to change, focusing on a single responsibility or task.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Clear Responsibilities**: Each class should encapsulate one functionality, making the system easier to understand and maintain.
  - **Regular Refactoring**: Review and refactor classes that become too complex or take on multiple responsibilities.
- **When to Use**:
  - When designing classes, always ask what single responsibility the class should fulfill.
  - Avoid creating "God Objects" that handle multiple tasks or functionalities.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Extensible Classes**: New functionalities should be added through extensions (inheritance, composition) rather than modifying existing code.
  - **Abstract Classes/Interfaces**: Use them to define behavior that can be implemented or extended.
- **When to Use**:
  - When designing components that might need to change in the future, prioritize extensibility.
  - Focus on creating a system that accommodates new features without disrupting existing functionality.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Definition**: Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the program.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Contract Adherence**: Derived classes should fulfill the contract established by base classes, ensuring expected behavior.
  - **Avoid Side Effects**: Ensure that changes in derived classes do not introduce unexpected behavior or side effects.
- **When to Use**:
  - Always verify that derived classes can be used interchangeably with their base classes.
  - Refactor code that breaks LSP to maintain the integrity of the system.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Specific Interfaces**: Ensure that clients only implement the methods they require, leading to cleaner designs.
  - **Manageable Interfaces**: Regularly refactor large interfaces into smaller ones as the system evolves.
- **When to Use**:
  - When designing interfaces, focus on the specific needs of clients rather than creating one-size-fits-all solutions.
  - Prioritize client-focused design over generalization.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
- **Key Points**:
  - **Dependency Injection**: Utilize DI frameworks or patterns to manage dependencies effectively, enhancing flexibility and testability.
  - **Regular Dependency Assessment**: Continuously evaluate dependencies to ensure the system remains flexible and maintainable.
- **When to Use**:
  - When designing systems, always prefer dependency injection over hard-coded dependencies.
  - Ensure that high-level components are not tightly coupled to specific implementations.
