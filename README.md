## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation bundles data and methods into a single unit (class), hiding internal details while exposing necessary functionalities.

#### Key Points:
- Separates public interface from internal implementation.
- Simplifies object interactions and protects internal state.

#### When to Use:
- To hide an object's internal state and expose specific functionalities.
- To ensure data integrity by controlling access to attributes.

### Abstraction
Abstraction reduces complexity by hiding unnecessary details, allowing users to interact with systems at a high level.

#### Key Points:
- Simplifies interactions (e.g., using a remote).
- Changes to internal implementations do not affect external users.

#### When to Use:
- To provide a simplified interface to a complex system.
- To hide implementation details from users.

### Inheritance
Inheritance allows creating new classes based on existing ones, promoting code reuse through an "is-a" relationship.

#### Key Points:
- Reduces redundancy and promotes code reuse.
- Changes in a base class propagate to derived classes.

#### When to Use:
- When there's a clear "is-a" relationship.
- To reuse properties and behaviors from existing classes.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism allows treating different types as instances of a common super type, enabling flexibility and extensibility.

#### Key Points:
- Supports dynamic method resolution.
- Facilitates code extension without modifying existing logic.

#### When to Use:
- To treat different objects uniformly through a common interface.
- To allow varied implementations while sharing a common interface.

### Coupling
Coupling indicates the degree of dependency between classes. Low coupling enhances flexibility, while high coupling can lead to fragility.

#### Key Points:
- High coupling complicates modifications and maintenance.
- Low coupling enhances maintainability and flexibility.

#### When to Use:
- Strive for low coupling to improve maintainability.
- Use dependency injection to reduce coupling and enhance flexibility.

### Composition
Composition involves building complex types by combining simpler objects, emphasizing a "has-a" relationship.

#### Key Points:
- Promotes code reuse by assembling smaller, reusable components.
- Reduces the risk of tight coupling associated with inheritance.

#### When to Use:
- When you need flexibility in constructing objects from smaller components.
- When there is no clear "is-a" relationship, and a "has-a" relationship is more appropriate.
- To avoid limitations of inheritance, such as tight coupling and the fragile base class problem.

## SOLID Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Define Clear Responsibilities:** Ensure each class has one reason to change, focusing on a single task.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Divide functionality into distinct classes to make code easier to understand and maintain.
- **Refactor as Needed:** Regularly review and refactor classes that take on multiple responsibilities.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- **Design for Extension:** Create classes that can be extended without altering existing code.
- **Use Abstract Classes and Interfaces:** Allow for adding new functionalities through subclasses or implementing interfaces.
- **Favor Composition:** Consider composition for new features instead of modifying existing implementations.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Ensure Substitutability:** Verify that derived classes can replace base classes without altering expected behavior.
- **Maintain Contracts:** Ensure derived classes adhere to the contracts defined by base classes (e.g., method signatures, expected behaviors).
- **Avoid Side Effects:** Derived classes should not introduce side effects that would break the behavior of existing code.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Create Focused Interfaces:** Design interfaces that are specific to the clientâ€™s needs, avoiding unnecessary methods.
- **Limit Client Exposure:** Ensure clients depend only on the methods they need, promoting clean design.
- **Refactor Large Interfaces:** Split large interfaces into smaller, more manageable ones as requirements change.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Depend on Abstractions:** Ensure high-level modules rely on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations.
- **Use Dependency Injection:** Inject dependencies into classes rather than creating them internally to promote flexibility.
- **Maintain Loose Coupling:** Regularly assess dependencies to ensure the system remains flexible and easy to test.
